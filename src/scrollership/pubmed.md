## The shape of biomedical research

This interactive visualization displays 21 million scientific papers collected in the [PubMed database](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), maintained by the United States National Library of Medicine and encompassing all biomedical and life science fields of research.

You can scroll the narration in the left part of the screen, and interact with the visualization in the right part of the screen. Zooming in loads additional papers. Information about each individual paper appears on mouse-over, and clicking on a paper opens its PubMed page in a separate window. Search over titles is available in the upper-right corner.

Scroll down to read more! And see [our paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/xxx) for more details.

## Introduction

Over one million articles are being currently published every year in biomedicine and life sciences.
The sheer amount of publications makes it difficult to
track the evolution of biomedical publishing as a whole. 
Search engines like PubMed and Google Scholar allow to find specific
papers given suitable keywords and follow the citation networks that
these papers are embedded in, yet none of them allows to explore the
biomedical literature 'landscape' from a global perspective. This makes
it hard to see how research topics evolve over time, how different
fields are related to each other, or how new methods and techniques are
adopted in different fields.

To answer such questions,
we provide a bird's-eye view on the biomedical literature.

:::

:::chunk

Here we offer an approach that enables all of the above: a
global two-dimensional atlas of the biomedical and life science
literature which is based on the abstracts of all 21 million English
language articles contained in the PubMed database. To create the map,
we embedded the abstracts into two dimensions using the
transformer-based large language model [PubMedBERT](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3458754) combined
with the neighbor embedding method [t-SNE](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v9/vandermaaten08a.html).

Our map is based on the abstract texts alone, and did not use any
further metadata or information on citations or references.

:::

:::chunk

This visualization facilitates exploration of the
biomedical literature and can reveal aspects of the data that would not
be easily noticed with other analysis methods. We showcase the power of
our approach in four examples: 

1. [The emergence of the Covid-19 literature.](#covid-19)
2. [The evolution of different subfields of neuroscience](#neuroscience)
3. The uptake of machine learning (???)
4. [The distribution of gender imbalance across biomedical fields.](#gender)

The shared strategy in all of these is to formulate specific hypotheses
about the data based on the visual exploration, and then to confirm them by a dedicated statistical
analysis of the original high-dimensional dataset.

:::

:::chunk

We labeled the dataset by selecting 38 keywords contained in journal
titles that reflected the general topic of the paper. We based our
choice of keywords on lists of medical specialties and life science
branches that appeared frequently in the journal titles in our dataset.

Papers were assigned a label if their journal title contained that term. 
As a result, about a third of the papers in the dataset received labels.

The labels demonstrate that our map has sensible global organization:
_psychology_ papers are next to _psychiatry_ papers, _optics_ is next to 
_physics_, and so on. Overall, the left part of the map corresponds to life
sciences, while the right part corresponds to medicine.

While we use journal titles to assign labels, the actual data underlying this representation are **abstract texts**.
Here we color the map by length of each abstract (darker color: shorter abstracts; lighter color: longer abstracts). This, too, shows regional patterns, with some disciplines preferring longer abstracts than others.

:::chunk

Abstract lengths do not obey a smooth distribution: instead, they cluster at 150, 200, and 250 words,
likely because authors are constrained by journals' submission guidelines.

But when zooming in closer, temporal periods often become well segregated. In most individual fields, the temporal division is very strong: for example, here we see that science progresses within immunology and virology in such a way that recent articles have abstracts much more similar to each other than to articles from the 1970s and 1980s in the same fields.

## COVID-19

Strikingly, one area of the map contains only papers from 2020&ndash;21. 
These are papers on Covid-19.

We considered a paper Covid-related if it contained phrases like "Covid-19" or "SARS-CoV-2"
in the abstract text. Our dataset includes 132 thousand Covid-related papers, most 
of which are concentrated in this area.

We can group the Covid papers based on the presence of specific keywords in 
their title. All different kinds of Covid-related research appear in this cluster in microcosm, from treatment and epidemiology at the top, to social and family-related issues at the bottom. 

Vaccines appear as two major regions which are completely distinct: one involving the scientific effort to create and test vaccines, and the other (towards the bottom) involving the public health effort to get people to use the vaccines once they were widely available.

There was substantial heterogeneity of gender ratios within some of the individual disciplines, and our fine-grained map allowed us to zoom in further. For example, in healthcare (overall 49.6\% female first authors), there were male- and female-dominated regions in the map. One of the more male-dominated clusters (33.9\% female) focused on financial management while one of the more female ones (68.1\% female) -- on patient care. (Here we need to select only healthcare papers).

In our prior work[^Gonzalez2022], we used the
bag-of-words representation of PubMed abstracts and found we obstained the the highest $k$NN accuracy using the TF-IDF (term frequency inverse document frequency) representation with log-scaling. For computational
convenience we used truncated SVD to reduce dimensionality to 300, the largest dimensionality we could obtain given our RAM resources. (Note that we did not use SVD when using the BERT representation and worked directly with the 768-dimensional representation.)

Our journal-based labels do not constitute the ground truth for the
topic of each paper, and so the highest possible classification accuracy
is likely well below 100%. Nevertheless, we reasoned that the higher the
classification accuracy, the better the embedding, and found this metric
to be useful to compare different representations.

    x:
      field: tfidf.x
      transform: literal
    y:
      field: tfidf.y
      transform: literal
```

```button
label: "PubMedBERT"
api:
  duration: 4000
  encoding:
    filter: null
    x:
      field: x
      transform: literal
    y:
      field: y
      transform: literal
```

As you can see, the embeddings based on the TF-IDF and PubMedBERT representation showed
similar large-scale organization.
