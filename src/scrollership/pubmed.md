:::chunk

Over one million articles being currently published every year in biomedicine and life sciences alone. Information about academic publications in these fields is collected in the PubMed database, maintained by the United States National Library of Medicine
([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov){.uri}). It now
contains over 33 million scientific papers from the last 50 years.

This interactive presents a new approach to exploring this massive corpus by situating it spatially, and by making the entire corpus interactive and and self-contained in a browser.

This rapid growth of the biomedical literature makes it difficult to
track the evolution of biomedical publishing as a whole. For instance,
search engines like PubMed and Google Scholar allow to find specific
papers given suitable keywords and follow the citation networks that
these papers are embedded in, yet none of them allows to explore the
biomedical literature 'landscape' from a global perspective. This makes
it hard to see how research topics evolve over time, how different
fields are related to each other, or how new methods and techniques are
adopted in different fields. What is needed to answer such questions, is a bird's-eye view on the biomedical literature.

```api

duration: 2000

```
:::

:::chunk

In this site we develop an approach that enables all of the above: a
global two-dimensional atlas of the biomedical and life science
literature which is based on the abstracts of all 21 million English
language articles contained in the PubMed database. To create the map,
we embedded the abstracts into two dimensions using the
transformer-based large language model PubMedBERT [@pubmedbert] combined
with the neighbor embedding method $t$-SNE [@tsneoriginal]. Adapting
this pipeline to handle sample sizes on the scale of this entire corpus
of biomedical literature, our approach allows us to create a map with
the level of detail exceeding previous work by three orders of magnitude
[@Boyack2020; @borner2012design].

Improving these cites is easy, if we have them.

This visualization facilitates exploration of the
biomedical literature and can reveal aspects of the data that would not
be easily noticed with other analysis methods. We showcase the power of
our approach in four examples: 

1. [The emergence of the Covid-19 literature.](#covid-19)
2. [The evolution of different subfields of neuroscience](#neuroscience)
4. [The distribution of gender imbalance across biomedical fields.](#gender)

The shared strategy in all of these is to formulate specific hypotheses
about the data, and then to confirm them by a dedicated statistical
analysis of the original high-dimensional dataset.

# Overview

Each point here an interactive element of its own. The darkest articles are the oldest ones (from the 1980s or earlier), and the lightest ones are from the last few years.

We downloaded the complete PubMed database and, after initial filtering, were left with 20,687,150 papers with valid English abstracts, the majority of which (99.8%) were published between 1970 and 2021. For more details, see [the full paper](http://example.com).

Our goal was to generate a 2D embedding
of the abstract texts to facilitate exploration of the data. All our
embeddings were based on the abstract texts alone, and did not use any
further metadata or information on citations or references.[^1]

[^1]: Filtering included non-English papers, removing papers with unfinished abstracts, etc.

Our map, however, is not predominantly organized by time. Returning points to their 
original positions, it is clear that most regions contain articles from multiple different 
eras in fairly close proximity; only at the highest levels of magnification are temporal
periods well segregated.

We labeled the dataset by selecting 38 keywords contained in journal
titles that reflected the general topic of the paper. We based our
choice of keywords on lists of medical specialties and life science
branches that appeared frequently in the journal titles in our dataset.

Papers were assigned a label if their journal title contained that term,
either capitalized or not, and were left unlabeled otherwise. Journal
titles containing more than one term were assigned randomly to one of
them. About a third of the papers in the dataset have labels.

:::

:::chunk

Our journal-based labels do not constitute the ground truth for the
topic of each paper, and so the highest possible classification accuracy
is likely well below 100%. Nevertheless, we reasoned that the higher the
classification accuracy, the better the embedding, and found this metric
to be useful to compare different representations.

We used PubMedBERT [@pubmedbert] to obtain a numerical representation of
each abstract. Specifically, we used the [HuggingFace's `transformers`](/)
library and the publicly released [PubMedBERT model.](/)

:::TODO
Pubmed BERT link.
Transformers link
:::

In our prior work[^Gonzalez2022], we used the
bag-of-words representation of PubMed abstracts and found we obstained the the highest $k$NN accuracy using the TF-IDF (term frequency inverse document frequency) representation with log-scaling. For computational
convenience we used truncated SVD to reduce dimensionality to 300, the largest dimensionality we could obtain given our RAM resources. (Note that we did not use SVD when using the BERT representation and worked directly with the 768-dimensional representation.)

As you can see, the embeddings based on the TF-IDF and PubMedBERT representation showed
similar large-scale organization.

Looking at abstracts, we can also start to tell things about the types of work done.
Here, for instance, we've parsed out every place in the abstracts where the sample size for a project is indicated (`n = 300`, `n = 100`, etc.). Darker colors, representing smaller sample sizes, are clustered in specific areas of the map.

Articles also have lengths of various sorts. Some areas have substantially smaller abstracts than others.

In most of these fields, the temporal division is extremely strong: science progresses within immunology and virology in such a way that recent articles have abstracts much more similar to each other than to articles from the 1970s and 1980s in the same fields.

# COVID-19
But one area contains only papers from 2020-21. This is the 
COVID-19 island.

We considered a paper Covid-related if it contained at least one of the
following terms in its abstract: 'covid-19', 'COVID-19', 'Covid-19',
'CoViD-19', '2019-nCoV', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'coronavirus disease 2019',
'Coronavirus disease 2019'. Our dataset includes 132,802 Covid-related
papers.

The COVID cluster is

We then group the Covid papers based on the presence of keywords in 
their title. Papers were assigned a label if their title contained that
term, either capitalized or not. Paper titles containing more than one
term were assigned randomly to one of them. This resulted in 35,874
labeled Covid-related papers: 27.0% from the total amount of
Covid-related papers and 45.6% of the Covid-related papers from the main
Covid cluster in the embedding.

Within this cluster appear all different types of articles in microcosm, from treatment and epidemiology to social and family related issues at the bottom. Vaccines appear as two major regions
completely distinct: one involving the scientific effort to create and test vaccines, and the other (towards the bottom) involving the public health effort to get people to use the vaccines once they were widely available.

The Covid cluster is among the most regions in the map.
